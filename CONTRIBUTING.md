# 🙋‍♂️ Contribution 

Devcord is based on it's users and how much they love our module and our hard work. We are currently too small for
a sponsor, but you can always help us by contributing <3

# ❓ How do I contribute properly?

There are multiple ways you can find ways to contribute to us.
- Hunt for `TODO`s and `BUG`s in code comments
- Issues
- Fixing existing PRs

## TODO's

Sometimes in our code, we do not want to create new issues since the issue is minor. Instead, we label them as TODOs and/or BUGs. To contribute to these,
clone our repo into your machine and search for these keywords.

## Issues and PR fixing

If you do not want to contribute for TODOs and stuff, don't panic! We (almost) always have atleast one open issue, and contribute to that problem!
f anyone's PR hasn't been approved and has problems, you can join in! Fix their new code, and try reminding them of this!

### Showing your changes to us

To do this, clone your repository and make a new branch. make your changes there, and if done, PR it back to us. We will accept it if valid! :D
